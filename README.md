In this project, I performed data cleaning by identifying and correcting errors in the dataset, data processing by adding some customized columns, data analysis using pivot tables and Excel functions, and data visualization to extract insights. The insights gained from such analysis can guide the development of targeted interventions to reduce road accidents and save lives.
