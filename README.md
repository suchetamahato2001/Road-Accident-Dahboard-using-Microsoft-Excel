In this project, I collected data from the client and identified the stakeholders of the project. Here, I performed data cleaning as per the requirements, data processing by adding some customized columns in the data, data analysis using pivot tables and Excel functions, and data visualization to extract the insights. The insights gained from such analysis can guide the development of targeted interventions to reduce road accidents and save lives.
